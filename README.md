How to install this program : 

1) copy the executable into your downloads folder or anywhere you want
2) Run the executable like any program.
	a) Select the installation directory. The default is Program Files (x86) 
	   which is OK.
3) Once the program finishes installing navigate to "C:\Program Files (x86)\panel_builder"
unless you installed it in a different directory. 
	a) Once there right click on "panel_builder.exe" > Properties > check 
	   "Run this program as an administrator".  This is not a digitally signed 
	   application, which is why I think you need to be an administrator to run
	   it (not 100% sure on this one). 
4) A window should appear with the running application!
